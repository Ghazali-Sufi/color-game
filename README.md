# Color Game
- Welcome to the Color Game! This is a simple and fun project where you guess which of the colored tiles matches the color displayed in the box. The goal is to reach 20 points before making a wrong guess!

# How It Works
1. Random Color Display: A random color appears in the center box.
2. Your Task: Click on one of the six colored tiles you think matches the displayed color.
3. Scoring:
  - If you pick correctly, you earn 1 point.
  - If you pick incorrectly, the game ends, and you lose.
4. Win Condition: When your score reaches 20 points, you win the game!
